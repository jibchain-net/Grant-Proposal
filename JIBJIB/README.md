## Ecosystem Value Proposition:

What is the problem statement this proposal hopes to solve for the JIBChain ecosystem?
-Problem Statement:
The JIBChain ecosystem, like many blockchain environments, faces challenges that can hinder its broader adoption and utility. 
These challenges include high transaction fees, complexity in user experience, limited mainstream appeal, and underutilization of blockchain's potential in various sectors. 
The introduction of JIBJIB aims to address these issues, thereby enhancing the overall value and functionality of the JIBChain ecosystem.
Solutions Offered by JIBJIB:
1.Eliminating High Transaction Fees 2.Simplifying User Experience 3.Enhancing Mainstream Appeal 4.Driving Ecosystem Utilization 5.Broadening Blockchain Applications 6.Community Engagement and Governance

How does your proposal offer a value proposition solving the above problem?

-Our proposal offers a value proposition for the JIBChain ecosystem by introducing JIBJIB, a zero-fee meme coin that simplifies transactions
, broadens mainstream appeal, and encourages ecosystem utilization. JIBJIB addresses the high cost of transactions by eliminating fees
, making blockchain accessible for everyday use. Its engaging and relatable nature as a meme coin attracts a wider audience, fostering greater adoption. Additionally
, it serves as a catalyst for innovation within the ecosystem, promoting the development of new applications and services. In essence, JIBJIB is designed to make blockchain technology more approachable
, affordable, and applicable across various sectors, thereby solving key challenges faced by the JIBChain ecosystem.

Why will this solution be a source of growth for the JIBChain ecosystem?
-JIBJIB, as a zero-fee meme coin, will drive growth for the JIBChain ecosystem by significantly lowering the barrier to blockchain adoption, 
attracting a broader audience with its engaging nature, and stimulating the development and use of decentralized applications. 
This approach enhances user engagement and expands the ecosystem's utility, leading to increased activity and innovation on the JIBChain.

Has your project previously applied for an JBC grant? If successful, please link to your previous grant proposal and provide a brief update on milestones achieved with the grant. If unsuccessful, and this is a resubmission, please specify how you have incorporated significant changes in accordance with feedback.
-We have never applied for funding from JBC.

## Number of JBC tokens requested: 
300,000 JBC
For Comunity Event 150,000 JBC
For Swap JIBJIB pool  150,000 JBC


## Did the project apply for or receive JBC tokens through the Foundation Partner Fund?:
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No (Individual)

## If JBC tokens were requested from the Foundation Partner Fund, what was the amount?:
- none

## How much will your project match in co-incentives? 
(not required but recommended, when applicable):

- Our project plans to match co-incentives proportionally to the engagement and investment received from the community and stakeholders. 
The exact amount will be dynamic, reflecting the level of participation and contribution to the JIBChain ecosystem. This approach ensures a commitment to mutual growth and shared success.

## Proposal for token distribution:

- Our proposal for token distribution includes allocating 100,000 JBC for community events to engage and reward active participation
, and 150,000 JBC to establish a swap pool for JIBJIB, facilitating liquidity and encouraging trading activities within the ecosystem.

## How will the JBC tokens be distributed? (please include % allocated to different initiatives such as user rewards/marketing/liquidity mining. Please also include a justification as to why each of these initiatives align with the problem statement this proposal is solving.) 
- 100% is to place an LP/Project Token as a reward in the GameFi.

## Over what period of time will the tokens be distributed for each initiative? Shorter timelines are preferable to longer timelines. Shorter timelines (on the order of weeks) allow teams to quickly demonstrate achievement of milestones, better facilitating additional grants via subsequent proposals.

- The tokens will be distributed over a period of 6 months: 150,000 JBC for community events will be distributed evenly across monthly events
, and 150,000 JBC for the JIBJIB swap pool will be allocated at the beginning to establish initial liquidity, ensuring immediate functionality and user engagement.

## Please list the milestones/KPIs you expect to achieve for each initiative, considering how each relates to incentivizing sustainable usage and liquidity on JIBChain. Please keep in mind that progress towards these milestones/KPIs should be trackable.Why will incentivized users and liquidity on JIBChain remain after incentives dry up?

- Milestones/KPIs for Each Initiative:

For Community Events (150,000 JBC):

Milestone 1: Increase in community membership by 25% each month.
Milestone 2: Monthly active participation in events (tracked via event registrations and interactions).
Milestone 3: Social media engagement growth by 30% (likes, shares, comments).

For JIBJIB Swap Pool (150,000 JBC):

Milestone 1: Achieve a 20% month-over-month increase in swap transactions.
Milestone 2: Maintain or increase the number of unique wallet interactions with the pool.
Milestone 3: Consistent liquidity growth within the swap pool.

Sustainability Post-Incentives:
Users and liquidity on JIBChain are expected to remain post-incentives due to the established community engagement
, habitual use of the platform, and the intrinsic value and utility of JIBJIB in the ecosystem.
The initiatives aim to create a self-sustaining cycle of activity and interest, ensuring continued participation even after incentive programs conclude.
